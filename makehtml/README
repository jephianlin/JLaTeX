Instruction for building htmls from bibtex

Workflow: 
My CV will produce active-CV.i.aux (i=1~5).  The makeall shell will do the following for each of active-CV.i.aux (only i=1~4):
1. aux2bib: change aux to bib
2. bib2bib: combine the produced bib with Coauthor.bib (this is to add hyperlink to authors and avoid the \noopsort issue.)
3. bib2html: change the produced bib to html, producing 1)accepted 2)submitted 3)invitedsym 4)contributed.

Requirement:
Assuming working on BASE folder. JLaTeX should be a folder in BASE. The aux files and the make*** shells need to be in BASE folder.

Step-by-step Instruction:
1. Clone JLaTeX in BASE. 
   (git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/jephianlin/JLaTeX.git
    git pull origin master)
2. Move all files in JLaTeX/makehtml/ to BASE.
   (When at JLaTeX/ do
    cp makehtml/* ..)
3. Download active-CV.i.aux (i=1~4) from SageMathCloud>CV to BASE.
   (When at BASE/ do
    ./getauxes)
4. Run ./makeall in BASE.
5. Upload all 4 html files to SageMathCloud>CV>webpage.
   (When at BASE/ do
    ./sendauxes)
6. Push from SageMathCloud to GitHub to update the webpage.
   (When at SMG>webpage/ do
    git add * -v
    git commit -m "Update info"
    git push origin master)
