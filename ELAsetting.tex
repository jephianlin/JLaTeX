%%General Notes for SIAM
%%SIAM doesn't like amsthm.
%%SIAM doesn't like hyperref.
%%SIAM doesn't like amsthm, so no theoremstyle.
%%SIAM doesn't like \*, so no \newtheorem*.
%%SIAM covers theorem, lemma, proposition, corollary, definition.
%%Sol: Define new environments.
%%SIAM use keywords, AM(S) environments.
%%SIAM doesn't take pdf file, so use eps instead.
%%Sol: Ask IPE to save as eps file, or learn Tikz.
%%SIAM has remunerate and romannum, but I don't want to change.
%%Sol: enumerate<->remunerate, and use romannum if you wish.
%%SIAM doesn't allow pdflatex. 
%%Sol: Write a bash or bat in Linux or Windows:
%%#!/bin/bash (for Linux)
%%latex file.tex
%%bibtex file.aux
%%latex file.tex
%%dvips file.dvi
%%ps2pdf file.pdf
